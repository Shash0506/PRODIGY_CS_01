Prodigy Infotech Internship - Task 01

🔐 Project Overview
This repository contains my solution for Task 02 of the Prodigy Infotech Internship. The task was to implement the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using a user-defined shift value.

📊 Objective
 
 Design and develop a Python program that:
  1. Takes user input for a message and a shift value.
  2. Encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
  3. Decrypts the message back to its original form.
  4. Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  5. Ignores non-alphabetic characters (they remain unchanged).

🎯 Conclusion

 This project strengthened my understanding of:
  1. Basic cryptography techniques like Caesar Cipher.
  2. String manipulation and control flow in Python.
  3. Taking dynamic user input and error handling.
